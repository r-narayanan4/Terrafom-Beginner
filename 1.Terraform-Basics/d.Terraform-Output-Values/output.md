# Terraform Output Values

Terraform allows you to define output values to display important information about your infrastructure after it's been created or updated. Output values can be useful for providing URLs, IP addresses, or any other information you need to access or reference in other parts of your infrastructure or applications.

## Usage

To define an output value in Terraform, you use the `output` block in your configuration file. Once your Terraform configuration is applied, you can retrieve the output values using the `terraform output` command.
