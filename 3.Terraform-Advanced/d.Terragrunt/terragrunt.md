# Terragrunt

Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state.

## What is Terragrunt?

Terragrunt is a thin wrapper for Terraform that provides extra tools for working with multiple Terraform modules, remote state, and keeping your configurations DRY. It supports locking, remote state management, and helps with the organization of your Terraform codebase.

## Key Features:

- **DRY Configurations**: Terragrunt helps you keep your configurations DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by enabling you to reuse configurations across multiple Terraform modules.

- **Remote State Management**: Terragrunt simplifies remote state management, making it easier to store your Terraform state file in a remote backend such as S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage.

- **Locking**: Terragrunt supports state locking, preventing concurrent modifications to your infrastructure and ensuring data consistency.

- **Workspace Management**: It provides commands to manage different workspaces in Terraform, allowing you to manage multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod) more efficiently.

## Getting Started

To get started with Terragrunt, follow these steps:

1. Install Terragrunt by following the instructions in the [official documentation](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/install/).

2. Set up your Terraform configurations and convert them to use Terragrunt configurations. Check out the [Terragrunt documentation](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/) for more information.
