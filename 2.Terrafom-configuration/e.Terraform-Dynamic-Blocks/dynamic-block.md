# Terraform Dynamic Blocks

Terraform Dynamic Block is important when you want to create multiple resources inside of similar types. Instead of copying and pasting the same Terraform configuration in the Terraform file, dynamic blocks offer a more efficient and scalable solution, particularly useful when creating numerous resources.

If we describe Terraform dynamic blocks in simple words, they function similarly to a for loop, iterating over a set of data to create dynamic resources. With dynamic blocks, you can create nested repeatable blocks such as settings, ingress rules, etc.

## Use Cases

- **Managing Multiple Instances**: When provisioning multiple instances of the same type, dynamic blocks can be used to define and configure each instance without duplicating code.

- **Creating Repetitive Resources**: For scenarios where you need to create a large number of similar resources (e.g., network rules, IAM policies), dynamic blocks streamline the process by allowing you to define a template once and apply it dynamically.

- **Configuration Management**: Dynamic blocks are useful for managing complex configurations where different instances require similar but slightly different settings. This can include resource tagging, security group rules, and environment-specific configurations.
