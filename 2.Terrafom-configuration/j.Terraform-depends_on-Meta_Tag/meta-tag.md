# Understanding the "depends_on" Meta-Argument in Terraform

The "depends_on" meta-argument in Terraform is a powerful tool used to specify dependencies between resources within a Terraform configuration.

This meta-argument allows Terraform to establish the correct order for creating, modifying, and destroying resources. By defining dependencies, Terraform ensures that resources are created or modified only after the resources they depend on have been created or modified.

For detailed instructions on how to utilize the "depends_on" meta-argument in Terraform and its practical applications, refer to [this resource](https://jhooq.com/terraform-depends-on/).

Note: Properly managing dependencies using "depends_on" is crucial for ensuring the correct and predictable behavior of your Terraform infrastructure.
